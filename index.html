    <h3 id="shopkicks-heading">Shopkicks</h3>
      <p><i>Shopkicks is an app made for both Android and IOS devices, and can be found in the Google Play Store or Apple App Store</i></p>

      <h4><strong>What is Shopkicks?</strong></h4>

      <p>Shopkicks is an app where you can earn cash by walking into stores and scanning items.</p>
      <p>You have the option to pay for things, but the app is completely free to use.</p>
      <p>I have made over $250 starting late Spring of 2019.</p>
      <p>All because of scanning items and walking into stores, I recieved free money!</p>

      <p>Although the very long time frame to only earn $250, I only do it on the weekends, and only scan items in one store.</p>

      <p>Depending on your activity, you can make money yourself.</p>
      <p>You can cash out in many different ways like in cash through PayPal, or gift cards to retail stores like Walmart, Target, or restuarants like Starbucks.</p>

    <h3 id="ibotta-heading">Ibotta</h3>
    <p><i>Ibotta is an app made for both Android and IOS devices, and can be found in the Google Play Store or Apple App Store</i></p>

    <h4><strong>What is Ibotta?</strong></h4>
    <p>Ibotta is a rebates app where you can get money back for buying items at large retail stores.</p>
    <p>The amount that you can get back varies on the item that you are purchasing, so it would be a while till you earn, however, bonuses are offered.</p>
    <p>Bonuses give you more money by the number of items that you purchase in a given time frame.</p>
    <p>You can cash out when you reach the $20 treshhold, and can also cashout in cash with paypal or giftcards for retail stores.</p>
    <p>I have recieved back $150 using Ibotta, saving me money.</p>

    <h3 id="mistplay-heading">Mistplay</h3>
    <p><i>Mistplay is an app made for Android devices only, and can be found in the Google Play Store</i></p>

    <h4><strong>What is Mistplay?</strong></h4>
    <p>Mistply is an app where you get paid for playing games!</p>
    <p>You can earn points for playing games, and you earn more points the longer you play.</p>
    <p>As you play, you can level up, increasing the amount of units you recieve, and the rate at which you earn xp in a game.</p>
    <p>I have made $50 using this app</p>
    <p>I earned $5 within the first week, of just continously playing one game.</p>
    <p>The amount of game exp that you can earn has a cap, which resets daily, so you cannot just keep your device on all day and earn points. It is best if you use more than one game so you can earn more points than I did off of just one game.</p>
    <p>You can cash out in Visa prepaid cards, which can be used as cash, and gift cards for other stores, including Amazon or eBay.</p>

    <h3 id="fetch-heading">Fetch Rewards</h3>
    <p><i>Fetch Rewards is an app made for Android devices and IOS devices, and can be found in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.</i></p>

    <h4><strong>What is Fetch Rewards?</strong></h4>
    <p>Fetch Rewards is an app where you can earn cash back by scanning your recipts.</p>
    <p>There are two main ways to earn money</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Buyng a product from a brand that they support</li>
      <li>Scanning your recipt without having to purchase a product through one of there many supported brands</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you purchase a product that has a supported brand, you can earn additional points</p>
    <p>You don't always have to purhase products from supported brands to earn bonuses because Fetch offers bonuses for just scanning recips!</p>
    <p>I have only made $15 using Fetch Rewards because I do not use it often, and I occassionaly forget to scan my recipts. </p>
